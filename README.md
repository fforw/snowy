A HTML5 snow effect with random generated snow flakes.

## Prerequisites

You need nodejs ( http://nodejs.org/ ). Make sure to execute "npm install" to download all npm dependencies
after checking this out.

You also need to install gulp globally with "npm install -g gulp" (might need sudo/root/Administrator privileges
depending on your OS).

## Building

use "gulp" to just build, and "gulp watch" to enable streaming build.
